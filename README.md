  ## Description
  This is a README file generator using node.js, it implements the use of the inquirer and filesystem node packages to generate a professional readme file based on the responses from user input to prompts in a terminal. Includes generation of licensing badge and links to authors github and email.

  This README itself was generated using the app. You can find a demonstration of that process [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/141h7A1P8k3hPWwLa86HigRTpJ2MHGptO/view).
