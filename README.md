  ## Description
  This is a readme generator using the techniques of node.js we learnt in class over the previous few weeks, it implements the use of the inquirer npm and filesystem to generate a professional readme file based on the responses from user input to prompts in a terminal.

  This readme itself was generated using the app. You can find a demonstration of that process [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/141h7A1P8k3hPWwLa86HigRTpJ2MHGptO/view).
